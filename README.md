## Structure and Semantics

    HTML uses elements, which are the building blocks of web pages.
    Each element is defined by tags, such as `<h1>` for headings and `<p>` for paragraphs.
    Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.

## Hyperlinks

    HTML allows for the creation of hyperlinks, enabling users to navigate between different web pages easily.
    Hyperlinks are created using the <a> tag, which can link to other pages or resources.

## Multimedia Support

    HTML5, the latest version, supports multimedia elements like audio and video through tags like `<audio>` and `<video>`.
    It also includes the <canvas> element for drawing graphics on the fly.
